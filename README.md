# Moolisp

Moolisp is a simple Lisp-like language implemented in C. It is a
project created as part of the "Make a Lisp" challenge, which
challenges participants to create their own Lisp interpreter in any
language.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To build and run Moolisp, you will need:

* A C compiler
* CMake
* GNU Readline

### Building Moolisp

To build Moolisp, run the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:RolandMarchand/moolisp.git &&
cd moolisp &&
mkdir build &&
cmake -S . -B build &&
cd build &&
make
```

This will compile the `moolisp` executable. You can then run Moolisp
with:

```bash
./src/moolisp
```

### Using Moolisp

Moolisp supports a subset of Lisp syntax, including lists, symbols,
and basic arithmetic. You can interact with the Moolisp interpreter by
entering expressions at the prompt.

For example, you can evaluate a simple arithmetic expression like
this:

```scheme
üêëŒª (+ 1 2)
3
```

You can also define variables and functions:

```scheme
üêë) (define pi 3.14159)
pi
üêë) (define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
square
üêë) (square pi)
9.86959
```

For more information on using Moolisp, see the included docs
directory.
